        <div class="content">
        <h4> Communication</h4>
      <p> Communication is a process. It occurs between two or more people (the speaker and the receiver). It can be expressed through written or spoken words, actions (nonverbal), or both spoken words and nonverbal actions at the same time. </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Elements of Communication</button>
        <div class="content">
      <p> 1. Speaker- the source of information or message. <br> 
          2. Message -the information, ideas, or thoughts conveyed by the speaker in words or in actions. <br> 
          3. Encoding -the process of converting the message into words, actions, or other forms that the speaker understands.  <br>
          4. Channel -the medium or the means, such as personal or non-personal, verbal, or nonverbal, in which the encoded message is conveyed.  <br>
          5. Decoding -the process of interpreting the encoded message of the speaker by the receiver. <br>
          6. Receiver -the recipient of the message, or someone who decodes the message.  <br>
          7. Feedback-the reactions, responses, or information provided by the receiver. <br>
          8. Context -the environment where communication takes place.  <br>
          9. Barrier -the factors that affect the flow of communication. </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Models of Communication </button>
        <div class="content">
      <p> 1. Shannon-Weaver Model-Known as the mother of all communication models, the Shannon-Weaver model (1949) depicts communication as linear or one-way process consisting of five elements: source (producer of message); a transmitter (encoder of message into signals); a channel (signals adapted for transmission); a receiver 1(decoder of message from the signal); and a destination. This model, however, has been criticized for missing one essential element in the communication process: feedback. Without feedback, the speaker will not know whether the receiver understands the message or not. <br>
      2. Transaction Model- Unlike the Shannon-Weaver Model, which is a one-way process, the Transaction Model is a two-way process with the inclusion of feedback as one element. <br>
      3. Schramm Model- A modified Shannon-Weaver Model by Schramm (1954). </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Functions of Communication </button>
        <div class="content">
    <p> Basically, there are five functions of communication. These are control, social interaction, motivation, emotional expression, and information dissemination. <br> <br>
        1. Control- Communication functions to control behavior. <br>
        2. Social Interaction Communication allows individuals to interact with others. <br>
        3. Motivation - Communication motivates or encourages people to live better. <br>
        4. Emotional expression - Communication facilitates people's expression of their feelings and emotions. <br>
        5. Information dissemination - Communication functions to convey information. </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Features of an Effective Communication</button>
        <div class="content">
    <p> Features of an Effective Communication In their pioneer book Effective Public Relations, Professors Broom, Cutlip, and Center (2012) list the Cs of Effective Communication. This list is widely used today, especially in public relations and advertising. <br> <br>

    1. Completeness - Complete communication is essential to the quality of the communication process in general. Hence, communication should include everything that the receiver needs to hear for him/her to respond, react, or evaluate properly. <br>
    2. Conciseness - Conciseness does not mean keeping the message short but making it direct or straight to the point. Insignificant or redundant information should be eliminated from the communication that will be sent to the recipient. <br>
    3. Consideration - To be effective, the speaker should always consider relevant information about his/her receiver such as mood, background, race, preference, education, status, and needs, among others. By doing so, he/she can easily build rapport with the audience. <br>
    4. Concreteness - Effective communication happens when the message is concrete and supported by facts, figures, and real-life examples and situations. In this case, the receiver is more connected to the message conveyed.  <br>
    5. Courtesy-The speaker shows courtesy in communication by respecting the culture, values, and beliefs of his/her receivers. Being courteous at all times creates a positive impact on the audience. <br>
    6. Clearness - Clearness in communication implies the use of simple and specific words to express ideas. It is also achieved when the speaker focuses only on a single objective in his/her speech so as not to confuse the audience. <br>
    7. Correctness - Correctness in grammar eliminates negative impact on the audience and increases the credibility and effectiveness of the message. </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Barriers to Communication</button>
        <div class="content">
    <p> 1. Emotional barriers - to communication are usually due to a lack of emotional awareness or control, often referred to as emotional intelligence. By better understanding our inner emotions, we can communicate more productively in the workplace and our everyday lives. <br>
      Example: <br>
    You are having a bad day or you feel frustrated. <br>
    Solution: <br> 
    Recognize these kinds of emotion, and politely ask the other person to give you a moment so you can relax or calm yourself. <br>
        2. Use of Jargon - overuse of jargon can mean people disconnect from your message, feel isolated and ultimately lead to miscommunication. <br>
        Example: <br>
    You are a scientist discussing a certain weather phenomenon with your neighbor who does not know much about the topic. <br>
    Solution: <br> 
    Jargon refers to the set of specialized vocabulary in a certain field. To avoid communication breakdown due to lack of clarity. adjust your language; use layman's terms or simple words.
        3. Lack of Confidence - can be a major barrier to effective communication. Shyness, difficulty being assertive, or low self-worth can hinder your ability to make your needs and opinions known. <br>
        Example: <br> 
      You are asked to share something about your day or weekend, but you are hesitant because you are shy. <br>
    Solution: <br>
    Develop self-confidence by joing organizations where you can share and develop your interest. Look for opportunities in your school or community that will help you find your strengths and improve your abilities. <br> 
        4. Noisy Environment - the noise might distract the receiver, causing them not to hear the sender's message properly. Or it might distract the sender, making it difficult for them to communicate the message effectively. Either way, noise becomes a barrier to communication. <br>
        Example: <br>
      You are having a conversation with some friends when a song was played loudly. <br>
    Solution: <br>
    Recognize that noise is a common barrier. Make some adjustments by asking someone to minimize the volume or by looking for a quiet area where you can resume the conversation.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Verbal Communication & Nonverbal Communication</button>
        <div class="content">
      <h4>Verbal Communication</h4>
      <p> Verbal Communication - refers to an interaction in which words are used to relay a message. For effective and successful verbal communication, use words to express ideas which can be easily understood by the person you are talking to. Consider appropriateness, brevity, clarity, ethics, and vividness when engaging in this type of communication. <br> <br>
      1. Appropriateness - The language that you use should be appropriate to the environment or occasion (i.e., whether formal or informal). <br> 
      2. Brevity - Speakers who often use simple yet precise and powerful words are found to be more credible. Try to achieve brevity by being more direct with your words. Avoid fillers and insubstantial expressions which do not add to the message, such as "uh," "you know," "I guess,' and others. <br>
      3. Clarity - The meanings of words, feelings, or ideas may be interpreted differently by a listener; hence, it is essential for you to clearly state your message and express your ideas and feelings. <br>
      4. Ethics - Words should be carefully chosen in consideration of the gender, roles, ethnicity, preferences, and status of the person or people you are talking to. <br>
      5. Vividness - Words that vividly or creatively describe things or feelings usually add color and spice to communication. Hence, you are encouraged to find ways to charm your audience through the use of vivid words. </p> <br>
      <h4>Nonverbal Communication</h4>
      <p> Nonverbal communication - refers to an interaction where behavior is used to convey and represent meanings. All kinds of human responses that are not expressed in words are classified as nonverbal communication. Examples of nonverbal communication are stares, smiles, tone of voice, movements, manners of walking, standing and sitting, appearance, style of attire, attitude towards time and space, personality, gestures, and others. Mastery of nonverbal communication is important for several reasons: <br> 
      1. It enhances and emphasizes the message of your speech, thus making more meaningful, truthful, and relevant.  <br>
      2. It can communicate feelings, attitudes, and perceptions without you saying a word.  <br>
      3. It can sustain the attention of listeners and keep them engaged in the speech.  <br>
      4. It gives the audience a preview to the type of speaker you are.  <br>
      5. It makes you appear more dynamic and animated in your delivery.  <br>
      6. It serves as a channel to release tension and nervousness.  <br>
      7. It helps make your speech more dramatic.  <br>
      8. It can build a connection with listeners.  <br>
      9. It makes you a credible speaker.  <br>
      10. It helps you vary your speaking style and avoid a monotonous delivery.</p>
  </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Intercultural Communication</button>
        <div class="content">
    <p> Intercultural communication happens when individuals interact, negotiate, and create meanings while bringing in their varied cultural backgrounds (Ting-Toomey, 1999). For some scholars, intercultural communication pertains to communication among people from different nationalities (Gudykunst, 2003). Still, others look at intercultural communication as communication that is influenced by different ethnicities, religions, and sexual orientations. Both interpretations show that intercultural communication takes place when people draw from their cultural identity to understand values, prejudices,language, attitudes, and relationships (Gudykunst & Kim, 2003). Moreover, this facet of communication can also be seen as a bargained understanding of human experiences across diverse societies. Simply put, intercultural communication is the sending and receiving of messages across languages and cultures. </p>
  </div>
   <button type="button" class="collapsible">Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity</button>
        <div class="content">
    <p> The Developmental Model of Intercultural Sensitivity (DMIS) offers a structure that explores how people experience cultural differences. According to Bennett and Bennett (2004), it has six stages. These are the following: <br> <br>
      Stage 1: Denial. The individual does not recognize cultural difference <br> 
      Stage 2: Defense. The individual starts to recognize cultural differences and is intimidated by them, resulting in either a superior view on own culture or an unjustified high regard for the new one. <br> 
      Stage 3: Minimization. Although individuals see cultural differences, they bank more on the universality of ideas rather than on cultural differences. <br> 
      Stage 4: Acceptance. The individual begins to appreciate important cultural differences in behaviors and eventually in values. <br> 
      Stage 5: Adaptation. The individual is very open to world views when accepting new perspectives. <br>
      Stage 6: Integration. Individuals start togo beyond their own cultures and see themselves and their actions based onmultifarious cultural viewpoints. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Characteristics of Competent Intercultural Communicators</button>
        <div class="content">
      <h4>Competent Intercultural Communicators</h4>
  <p> World Bank (2010) identifies the following traits that define a competent intercultural communicator.  <br>
      1. Flexibility and the ability to tolerate uncertainty high levels of uncertainly <br>
      2. Reflectiveness or mindfulness <br>
      3. Open-mindedness  <br>
      4. Sensitivity <br>
      5. Adaptability <br>
      6. Ability to engage in divergent thinking (or thinking creatively) and systems-level thinking (or thinking how each one in system or organization influences each other)  <br>
      7. Politeness </p>

  <p> Note that in addition to culture, other elements such as gender, age, social status, and religion must also be taken into consideration when communicating with others. Refrain from showing bias when talking to someone by following the tips below.  <br>
      1. Avoid stereotypes, i.e., generalizations about a certain group.  <br>
      2. Challenge gender norms; avoid using "he" and "man" to refer to a general group of people. To remedy this, you may use plural pronouns or rewrite a sentence to avoid using pronouns. The use of his/her is also acceptable.  <br>
      3. Do not talk down on younger people and the elderly.  <br>
      4. Be sensitive to the religious practices of others. <br>
      5. Be polite at all times; do not belittle people you perceive to be on a lower social class than you. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Types of Speech Context</button>
        <div class="content">
      <h4>Speech Context</h4>
    <p> 1. Intrapersonal- This refers to communication that centers on one person where the speaker acts both as the sender and the receiver of message. "The message is made up of your thoughts and feelings. The channel Is your brain, which processes what you are thinking and feeling. There is feedback in the sense that as you talk to yourself, you discard certain ideas and replace them with others.' (Hybels & Weaver, 2012, p 16) <br>
      Examples:  <br>
      - You spent the night thinking and analyzing why a student from the other class talked to you on the way home and you decided it probably meant nothing.  <br>
      - You felt happy while thinking about how your teacher appreciated you for submitting your project before the due date and you reflected on why this was so.  <br>
      2. Interpersonal- This refers to communication between and among people and establishes personal relationship between and among them. Solomon and Theiss (2013) state that "the interpart of the word highlights how interpersonal communication connects people... when you engage in interpersonal communication, you and another person become linked together... The personal part means that your unique qualities as a person matter during interpersonal communication..." </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Types of Interpersonal Context</button>
        <div class="content">
      <h4>Interpesonal Context</h4>
  <p> 1. Dyad Communication - communication that occurs between two people <br>
  Example: <br>
      - You offered feedback on the speech performance of your classmate. <br>
      - You provided comfort to friend who was feeling down. <br>
      2. Small Group- This refers to communication that involves at least three but not more than twelve people engaging in a face-to-face interaction to achieve a desired goal. In this type of communication, all participants can freely share ideas in a loose and open discussion. <br>
  Example: <br>
      - You are participating in an organizational meeting which aims to address the concerns of your fellow students. <br>
      - You are having a discussion with your group mates on how to finish the assigned tasks. <br>
      3. Public - This type refers to communication that requires you to deliver or send the message before or in front of a group. The message can be driven by informational or persuasive purposes. "In public communication, unlike in interpersonal and small group, the channels are more exaggerated. The voice is louder and the gestures are more expansive because the audience is bigger. The speaker might use additional visual channels such as slides or a Power Point presentation." (Hybels & Weaver, 2012, p 19) <br>
  Example: <br>
      - You deliver a graduation speech to your batch. <br>
      - You participate in a declamation, oratorical, or debate contest watched by a number of people. <br>
      4. Mass Communication-This refers to communication that takes place through television, radio, newspapers, magazines, books, billboards, internet, and other types of media. <br>
  Example:  <br>
      - You are a student journalist articulating your stand on current issues through the school's newspaper. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Types of Speech Style</button>
        <div class="content">
      <h4>Speech Style</h4>
  <p> The context dictates and affects the way people communicate, which results in various According to Joos (1968), there are five speech styles. speech styles. formal, and (5) frozen. Each style dictates what These are (1) intimate, (2) casual, (3) consultative, (4) observed. appropriate language or vocabulary should be used or observed.  <br> <br>
      1. Intimate- This style is private, which occurs between or among close family members or individuals.  The language used in this style may not be shared in public.  <br>
      2. Casual- This style is common among peers and friends. Jargon, slang, or the vernacular language are used.  <br>
      3. Consultative- This style is the standard one. Professional or mutually acceptable language is a must in this style. Examples of situations are communication between teachers and students, employers and employees, doctor and patient, judge and lawyer, or President and his/her constituents.  <br>
      4. Formal- This style is used in formal settings. Unlike the consultative style, this is one-way. Examples are sermons by priests and ministers, State of the Nation Address of the President, formal speeches, or pronouncements by judges. <br> 
      5. Frozen- This style is "frozen" in time and remains unchanged. It mostly occurs in ceremonies. Common examples are the Preamble to the Constitution, Lord's Prayer, and Allegiance to country or flag. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Types of Speech Act</button>
        <div class="content">
        <h4> Speech Act</h4>
      <p> A speech act is an utterance that a speaker makes to achieve an intended effect. Some of the functions which are carried out using speech acts are offering an apology, greeting, request, complaint, invitation, compliment, or refusal. A speech act might contain just one word or several words or sentences. For example, "Thanks" and "Thank you for always being there for me. I really appreciate it" both show appreciation regardless of the length of the statement. </p>
      <H4> Three Types of Speech Act </H4>
      <P>According to J. L. Austin (1962), a philosopher of language and the developer there are three types of acts in every utterance, given of the Speech Act Theory, the right circumstances or context. These are:  <br>
      1. Locutionary act - is the actual act of uttering. Ex.) "Please do the dishes.' <br> <br>
      2. Illocutionary act - is the social function of what said. By uttering the locution "Please do the dishes," the speaker requests the addressee to wash the dishes. <br> <br>
      3. Perlocutionary act - is the resulting act of what is said. This effect is based on the particular context in which the speech act was mentioned. "Please do the dishes" would lead to the addressee washing the dishes. <br> <br>
      There are also indirect speech acts which occur when there is no direct connection between the form of the utterance and the intended meaning. They are different in force (i.e., intention) from the inferred speech act. For example, read the following utterance. <br>
      "Can you pass the rice?" <br>
      Inferred speech act: Do you have the ability to hand over the rice? <br>
      Indirect speech act: Please pass the rice. <br>
      So while the utterance literally asks the addressee if he or she has the ability to hand a plate of rice, it actually indirectly requests the addressee to pass the rice to the speaker. </P>

      <H4> Performatives</H4>
     <P> Austin also introduced the concept of performative utterances: statements which enable the speaker to perform something just by stating it. In this manner, verbs that execute the speech act that they intend to effect are called performatives. A performative utterance said by the right person under the right circumstances results in a change in the world. Note that certain conditions have to be met when making performative utterance. For example, the phrase "1 now pronounce you husband and wife," when uttered by an authorized person such as a judge will have the actual effect of binding a couple in marriage. However, the same statement is uttered to the same couple in the same place by someone who is not authorized to if marry them-as in the case of the accompanying picture, a robot then there is no effect whatsoever because a condition was not met. </P>
    <h4> Searle's Classifications of Speech Act </h4>
     <p> As a response to Austin's Speech Act Theory, John Searle (1976), a professor from the University of California, Berkeley, classified illocutionary acts into five distinct categories.  <br>
      1. Assertive- a type of illocutionary actin which the speaker expresses belief about the truth of a proposition. Some examples of an assertive act are suggesting, putting forward, swearing, boasting, and concluding. <br>
      Example: <br>
      No one makes better pancakes than I do. <br> <br>
      2. Directive- a type of illocutionary actin which the speaker tries to make the addressee perform an action. Some examples of a directive act are asking, ordering, requesting, inviting, advising, and begging. <br>
      Example: <br>
      Please close the door. <br> <br>
      3. Commissive- a type of illocutionary act which commits the speaker to doing something in the future. Examples of a commissive act are promising, planning, vowing, and betting.  <br>
      Example: <br>
      From now on, I will participate in our group activity.  <br> <br>
      4. Expressive- a type of illocutionary act in which the speaker expresses his/her feelings or emotional reactions. Some examples of an expressive act are thanking, apologizing, welcoming, and deploring.  <br>
      Example: <br>
      I am so sorry for not helping out in our group projects and letting you do all the work. <br> <br>
      5. Declaration- a type of illocutionary act which brings a change in the external situation. Simply put, declarations bring into existence or cause the state of affairs which they refer to. Some examples of declarations are blessing, firing, baptizing, bidding, passing a sentence, and excommunicating. <br> 
      Example: <br>
      You are fired! <br> <br>
      By saying that someone is fired, an employer causes or brings about the person's unemployment, thus changing his external situation.
      Always keep in mind that speech acts include concrete life interactions that require the appropriate use of language within a given culture. Communicative competence (i.e., the ability to use linguistic knowledge to effectively communicate with others) is essential for a speaker to be able to use and understand speech acts. Idioms and other nuances in a certain language might be lost or misunderstood by someone who does not fully grasp the language yet. </p>
  </div>
  <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Types of Communicative Strategy</button>
        <div class="content">
    <h4>Communicative Strategy</h4>
    <p> Since engaging in conversation is also bound by implicit rules, Cohen (1990) states that strategies must be the used to start and maintain a conversation. Knowing and applying grammar appropriately is one of most basic strategies to maintain a conversation. The following are some strategies that people use when communicating.  <br> <br>
    1. Nomination  <br>
    A speaker carries out nomination to collaboratively and productively establish a topic. Basically, when you employ this strategy, you try to open a topic with the people you are talking to. When beginning a topic in a conversation, especially ifit does not arise from a previous topic, you may start off with news inquiries and news announcements as they promise extended talk. Most importantly, keep the conversational environment open for opinions until the prior topic shuts down easily and initiates a smooth end. This could efficiently signal the beginning of new topic in the conversation. <br> <br> 
    2. Restriction  <br>
    Restriction in communication refers to any limitation you may have as a speaker. When communicating in the classroom, in a meeting, or while hanging out with your friends, you are typically given specific instructions that you must follow. These instructions confine you as a speaker and limit what you can say. For example, in your class, you might be asked by your teacher to brainstorm on peer pressure or deliver speech on digital natives. In these cases, you cannot decide to talk about something else. On the other a hand, conversing with your friends during ordinary days can be far more casual than these examples. Just the same, remember to always be on point and avoid sideswiping from the topic during the conversation to avoid communication breakdown.  <br> <br>
    3. Turn-taking  <br>
    Sometimes people are given unequal opportunities to talk because others take much time during the conversation. Turn-taking pertains to the process by which people decide who takes the conversational floor. There is a code of behavior behind establishing and sustaining a productive conversation, but the primary idea is to give all communicators a chance to speak. Remember to keep your words relevant and reasonably short enough to express your views or feelings. Try to be polite even if you are trying to take the floor from another speaker. Do not hog the conversation and talk incessantly without letting the other party air out their own ideas. To acknowledge others, you may employ visual signals like a nod, a look, or a step back, and you could accompany these signals with spoken cues such as "What do you think?" or "You wanted to say something?" <br> <br>
    4. Topic Control <br>
    Topic control covers how procedural formality or informality affects the development of topic in conversations. For example, in meetings, you may only have a turn to speak after the chairperson directs you to do so. Contrast this with a casual conversation with friends over lunch or coffee where you may take the conversational floor anytime. Remember that regardless of the formality of the context, topic control is achieved cooperatively. This only means that when a topic is initiated, it should be collectively developed by avoiding unnecessary interruptions and topic shifts. You can make yourself actively involved in the conversation without overly dominating it by using minimal responses like "Yes," "Okay," 'Go on"; asking tag questions to clarify information briefly like "You are excited, aren't you?", "It was unexpected, wasn't it?"; and even by laughing! <br> <br> 
    5. Topic Shifting <br>
    Topic shifting, as the name suggests, involves moving from one topic to another. In other words, it is where one part of a conversation ends and where another begins. When shifting from one topic to another, you have to be very intuitive. Make sure that the previous topic was nurtured enough to generate adequate views. You may also use effective conversational transitions to indicate a shift like "By the way,' "In addition to what you said," "Which reminds me of," and the like. <br> <br>
    6. Repair <br>
    Repair refers to how speakers address the problems in speaking, listening, and comprehending that they may encounter in a conversation. For example, if everybody in the conversation seems to talk at the same time, give way and appreciate other's initiative to set the conversation back to its topic. Repair is the self-righting mechanism in any social interaction (Schegloff et al, 1977). If there is a problem in understanding the conversation, speakers will always try to address and correct it. Although this the case, always seek to initiate the repair. <br> <br>
    7. Termination <br>
    Termination refers to the conversation participants' close-initiating expressions that end a topic in a conversation. Most of the time, the topic initiator takes responsibility to signal the end of the discussion as well. Although not all topics may have clear ends, try to signal the end of the topic through concluding cues. You can do this by sharing what you learned from the conversation. Aside from this, soliciting agreement from the other participants usually completes the discussion of the topic meaningfully. </p>

    <h4> The Speech Writing Process </h4>
    <p>Just like events planning, or any other activities, writing an effective speech follows certain steps or processes. The process for writing is not chronological or linear; rather, it is recursive. That means you have the opportunity to repeat a writing procedure indefinitely or produce multiple drafts first before you can settle on the right one. <br> <br>

    -   Conducting an audience analysis <br> 
    -   Determining the purpose of the speech  <br>
    -   Selecting topic  <br>
    -   Narrowing down a topic Gathering data <br>
    -   Selecting a speech pattern  <br>
    -   Preparing an outline  <br>
    -   Creating the body of the speech  <br>
    -   Preparing the introduction  <br>
    -   Preparing the conclusion <br>
    -   Editing and/or Revising  <br>
    -   Rehearsing <br> <br>
    The following are the components of the speechwriting process. <br> <br> 
    -   Audience analysis entails looking into the profile of your target audience. This is done so you can tailor-fit your speech content and delivery to your audience. The profile includes the following information. <br>
    -   Demography (age range, male-female ratio, educational background and affiliations or degree program taken, nationality, economic status, academic or corporate designations)  <br>
    -   Situation (time, venue, occasion, and size)  <br>
    -   Psychology (values, beliefs, attitudes, preferences, cultural and racial ideologies, and needs) <br> <br>
    The purpose for writing and delivering the speech can be classified into three --- to inform, to entertain, or to persuade.  <br>
    -   An informative speech provides the audience with a clear understanding of the concept or idea presented by the speaker. <br> 
    -   An entertainment speech provides the audience with amusement.  <br>
    -   A persuasive speech provides the audience with well-argued ideas that can influence their own beliefs and decisions. <br>
    The purpose can be general and specific. Study the examples below to see the differences. <br> <br>
    Example: <br>
    To inform: <br>
    -   To inform Grade 11 students about the process of conducting an automated student government election. <br>
    -   To inform Grade 11 students about the definition and relevance of information literacy today.  <br>
    -   To inform Grade 11 students about the importance of effective money management. <br> <br>
    To entertain: <br>
    -   To entertain Grade 11 students with his/her funny experiences in automated election. <br>
    -   To entertain Grade 11 students with interesting observations of people who lack information literacy. <br> 
    -   To entertain Grade 11 students with the success stories of the people in the community. <br> <br>
    To persuade: <br>
    -   To persuade the school administrators to switch from manual to automated student government election. <br>
    -   To persuade Grade 11 students to develop information literacy skills. <br>
    -   To persuade the school administrators to promote financial literacy among students. <br> <br>
    The topic is your focal point of your speech, which can be determined once you have decided on your purpose. If you are free to decide on a topic, choose one that really interests you. There are a variety of strategies used in selecting a topic, such as using your personal experiences, discussing with your family members or friends, free writing, listing, asking questions, or semantic webbing.  <br> <br>

    Narrowing down a topic means making your main idea more specific and focused. [he strategies in selecting a topic can also be used when you narrow down a topic. In the example below, "Defining and developing effective money management skills of Grade 11 students" is the specific topic out of a general one, which is "Effective money management.” <br> <br>

    Data gathering is the stage you collect ideas, information, sources, and references relevant or related to your specific topic. This can be done by visiting the library, browsing the web. observing a certain phenomenon or event related to your topic, conducting interview or survey. The data that you will gather will be very useful in making your speech informative, entertaining, or persuasive. <br> 

    Writing patterns, in general, that will help you organize the ideas related to your topic. Examples are biographical, categorical/topical, causal, chronological, comparison/contrast, problem-solution, and spatial. <br> <br>
    Below are different writing patterns from which you can select the one that best suits your topic and/or purpose. <br> <br>
    1. Biographical – presents descriptions of your life or of a person, famous or not. <br>
    2. Categorical/Topical – presents related categories supporting the topic. <br>
    3. Causal – presents cause-effect relationships. <br>
    4. Chronological – presents the idea in time order. <br>
    5. Comparison/Contrast – presents comparison/contrast of two or three points. <br>
    6. Problem-Solution – presents an identified problem, its causes, and recommend solutions. <br> <br>
    An outline is a hierarchical lis1 that shows the relationship of your ideas. Experts in public speaking state that once your outline is ready, two-thirds of your speech writing is finished. A good outline helps you see that all the ideas are in line with your main idea or message. The elements of an outline include introduction, body, and conclusion. 
    The body of the speech provides explanations, examples, or any details that can help you deliver your purpose and explain the main idea of your speech. One major consideration in developing the body of your speech is the focus or central idea. The body of your speech should only have one central idea. <br> <br>
    The following are some strategies to highlight your main idea: <br>
    -   Present real-life or practical examples.  <br>
    -   Show statistics. <br>
    -   Present comparisons. <br> 
    -   Share ideas from the experts or practitioners. <br> <br>
    The introduction is the foundation of your speech. Here, your primary goal is to get the attention of your audience and present the subject or main idea of your speech. Your first few words should do so. The following are some strategies: <br> <br>
    -   Use a real-life experience and connect that experience to your subject.  <br>
    -   Use practical examples and explain their connection to your subject. <br> 
    -   Start with a familiar or strong quote and then explain what it means.  <br>
    -   Use facts or statistics and highlight their importance to your subject. Tell a personal story to illustrate your point. <br> <br>

    The conclusion restates the main idea of your speech. Furthermore, it provides a summary, emphasizes the message, and calls for action. While the primary goal of the introduction is to get the attention of your audience, the conclusion aims to leave the audience with a memorable statement. The following are some strategies: <br> <br>
    -   Begin your conclusion with a restatement of your message.  <br>
    -   Use positive examples, encouraging words, or memorable lines from songs or stories familiar to your audience.  <br>
    -   Ask a question or series of questions that can make your audience reflect or ponder. <br> <br>
    Editing/Revising - your written speech involves correcting errors in mechanics, such as grammar, punctuation, capitalization, unity, coherence, and others. Andrew Dlugan (2013), an award-winning public speaker, lists six power principles for speech editing. Edit for focus. "So, what's the point? What's the message of the speech?" Ensure that everything you have written, from introduction to conclusion, is related to your central message. <br> <br>
    Edit for clarity - <br> 
    "I don't understand the message because the examples or supporting details were confusing." Make all ideas in your speech clear by arranging them in logical order (e.g., main idea first then supporting details, or supporting details first then main idea). <br> <br>
    Edit for concision- <br> 
    "The speech was all over the place; the speaker kept talking endlessly as if no one was listening to him/her." Keep your speech short, simple, and clear by eliminating unrelated stories and sentences and by using simple words. <br> <br>
    Edit for continuity -  <br>
    "The speech was too difficult to follow; I was lost in the middle." Keep the flow of your presentation smooth by adding transition words and phrases. <br> <br>
    Edit for variety -  <br>
    “I didn't enjoy the speech because it was boring." Add spice to your speech by shifting tone and style from formal to conversational and vice-versa, moving around the stage, or adding humor. <br> <br>
    Edit for impact and beauty -  <br>
    "There's nothing really special about the speech." Make your speech memorable by using these strategies: surprise the audience, use vivid descriptive images, write well-crafted and memorable lines, and use figures of speech. <br> <br>
    Rehearsing gives you an opportunity to identify what works and what does not work for you and for your target audience. Some strategies include reading your speech aloud, recording for your own analysis or for your peers or coaches to give feedback on your delivery. The best thing to remember at this stage is: "Constant practice makes perfect." </p>

    <h4> Some Guidelines in Speech Writing </h4>
    <p> 1. Keep your words short and simple. Your speech is meant to be heard by your audience, not read.  <br>
        2. Avoid jargon, acronyms, or technical words because they can confuse your audience.  <br>
        3. Make your speech more personal. Use the personal pronoun '1," but take care not to overuse if. When you need to emphasize collectiveness with your audience, use the personal pronoun "we."  <br>
        4. Use active verbs and contractions because they add to the personal and conversational tone of your speech.  <br>
        5. Be sensitive of your audience. Be very careful with your language, jokes, and nonverbal cues.  <br>
        6. Use metaphors and other figures of speech to effectively convey your point.  <br>
        7. Manage your time well; make sure that the speech falls under the time limit. </p>

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Tips for Effective Speech Delivery</button>
        <div class="content">
    <p> Following are more techniques and tips to help you deliver your speech well: <br> <br>
    1. Use a conversational style more often. This is the style that is more natural; it is the style that you always use when you express yourself with your family and friends. Audience members do not like the speaker to sound unnatural or exaggerated. <br>  <br>
    2. Look your audience members in the eye so they will feel that they are part of your speech. Eye contact should be maintained to keep the attention of your audience and enhance your delivery. <br> <br>
    3. Remember to adjust your volume to the size of the audience and the venue. When addressing a large audience, modulate your voice in such a way that you speak loudly without sounding like shouting or yelling. <br> <br>
    4. Vary your rate or speed to keep your audience interested and to avoid a monotone pattern. The audience might get bored if you speak very slowly and they might get confused if you speak very fast. Hence, your rate should be at an appropriate speed. <br> <br>
    5. Master your voice and find your pitch level (high or low). If you have a high pitch level, modulate or slightly move it down. If you have a low pitch level, modulate or slightly move it up. Your performance will definitely be affected if you do not modulate. <br> <br>
    6. Use pauses when you emphasize the most important words, phrases, or sentences. Your pauses should not last for three seconds. Otherwise, it will result in dead air or a moment of awkward silence. <br> <br>
    7. Pronounce and enunciate words correctly. You will confuse the audience if you mispronounce words, and it could distract them and affect your credibility. <br> <br>
    8. Avoid fillers or expressions that substitute actual words in your speech because these words are distracting. Examples of fillers are "like," "um," "ah," "uh,' and "er." To reduce the use of these fillers, detect the instances when you use them: Do you generally use fillers after each sentence, between different ideas, or whenever you make transitions? Then, instead of using them the next time you deliver a speech, simply stop and pause. <br> <br>
    9. Start your speech by standing straight and balancing your weight. This will give a positive first impression. <br> <br>
    10. Use precise movements. Avoid distracting mannerisms like swaying back and forth, leaning on the podium, licking or biting your lips, playing with your wristwatch or jewelry, scratching parts of your body, frowning, and others. Observe your mannerisms and learn how to avoid them when speaking in public. <br> <br>
    11. Avoid having a poker face or a highly animated face. These facial expressions appear distracting and may even be annoying. Instead, follow the most highly suggested lip: smile. However, make sure that the meaning of your speech reflects in your facial expressions; do not smile if you are talking about something sad. <br> <br>
    12. Dress properly and appropriately. Wearing the proper attire will make you look more confident and professional. Make sure not to overdress, as this may distract your audience. <br> <br>
    13. Observe ethics by coming prepared, being honest with your words, being polite, avoiding offensive words and back-biting or talking negative things about other people, or copying someone's work without proper documentation. <br> <br>
    14. Breathe in and out to relax before your speech. Most importantly, have fun. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Organizing and Delivering a (Manuscript Speech)</button>
        <div class="content">
    <h4>Manuscript Speech</h4>
    <p> When speaking from a manuscript, you write and deliver a speech word for word. The question is, for whom is the manuscript method most advantageous? <br> <br> </p>
    <h5> 1. Public figures </h5> <p> - Since public figures are always constrained by a hectic schedule, they need ghost writers. Consequently, they would have to read the text of the speech as itis. The President's State of the Nation Address (SONA) is a concrete example of this situation. </p>
    <h5> 2. Media personalities </h5> <p> - Speakers on radio and television always battle with time limits. For example, a televised panel discussion about a social issue may require radio and TV anchors to critically choose and refine the words of their speech in advance. </p>
    <h5> 3. Spokespersons for government and private organizations </h5> <p> - This public speaking role requires a great deal of contemplation and preparation. For example, we have speeches of different country's spokespersons in an international seminar on climate change. </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Tips in Using the Manuscript Method</button>
        <div class="content">
    <h4>Manuscript Methods</h4>
    <h4> 1. Prepare! </h4> <p>- Keep your text easy to use by neatly composing it in triple space. </p>
    <h4> 2. Mark! </h4> <p>- Own your manuscript by highlighting key words and phrases. This way you will be guided during the speech delivery. </p>
    <h4> 3. Practice! </h4> <p>- You can make a lot of notes on the draft of your manuscript during the first few rehearsals, but make sure to reprint your script, especially if you make too many changes. </p>
    <h4> 4. Practice some more! </h4> <p>- Read the text over and over orally. This will help you avoid mispronounced words, faulty starts, and wrong pauses. As you practice, vary the volume, rate, and pitch of your voice during appropriate points in the speech. </p>
    <h4> 5. Concentrate! </h4> <p>- Concentrate on keeping eye contact, but do not stare at only one section of the audience. It is best if you familiarize yourself with the most important parts of your speech. If you do this, you will be more confident in looking at your audience during the key points of the speech. </p>
    <h4> 6. Act it out! </h4> <p>- Use a lectern or a podium when practicing the speech. If you can find one before the actual speech delivery, practice using it so that you will be used to laying your notes flat on the podium and looking at them once in a while. </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Organizing and Delivering a (Memorized Speech) </button>
        <div class="content">
    <p> When should you memorize? Although keeping a speech in memory is needed only on very rare occasions, memorizing a speech can help you achieve a smooth and effortless delivery. You do not need to focus on notes or a manuscript. You can concentrate on maintaining eye contact with your audience, establishing rapport, and interacting with your audience. Since memorizing can be very tough and mechanical, it is best that you memorize short speeches for special occasions. A memorized speech works best for the introduction of a guest, acceptance of award or recognition, toast, eulogy, tribute, and the like.</p>
    </div>
     <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Tips in Memorizing a Speech </button>
        <div class="content">
    <h4>Memorizing a Speech</h4>
    <h5> 1. Break it down! </h5> <p> - You cannot memorize a speech in one sitting. If your speech has four paragraphs, you should focus on one paragraph at a time. Once you have memorized the first paragraph, focus on the next one. </p>
    <h5> 2. Build it up! </h5> <p> - After memorizing the speech in snippets, you need to put them together. Recite the first paragraph and move on to the second. After this, recite the first and second paragraphs and move on to the third. The next thing you know, you have completed your speech. </p>
    <h5> 3. Speak out! </h5> <p> - Do not memorize the speech silently. When you recite your speech over and over while memorizing it, your brain multitasks and aids your memory retention.</p>
    <h5> 4. Identify keys! </h5> <p> - Identify a key point in every paragraph. Even if you miss out some of the words in the actual speech delivery, you can easily expound on the key points. </p>
    <h5> 5. Have a break! </h5> <p> - After memorizing some parts of your speech, take a break for some hours or for a day. After this, recite the speech again. This will test how well you can recall what you think you have memorized.</p>
    <h5> 6. Record and listen! </h5> <p> - Record yourself delivering the speech and a listen to it over and over again. Like a song, the speech will get stuck in your head. </p>
    <h5> 7. Use note cards! </h5> <p> - Write one key point on one note card. Bring these note cards wherever you go and take them out whenever you have extra time to memorize, especially during idle times of the day.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Organizing and Delivering an (Impromptu Speech) </button>
    <div class="content">
    <h4>Definition of Impromptu Speech</h4>
    <p> Impromptu speeches are delivered with little or no time for preparation. In most instances, you are called to speak at the to be knowledgeable about the spur of the moment because you are expected subject. For example, your teacher assigned you to read an article before the class starts. Then, during the class you were asked to deliver an impromptu speech about what you have learned from the article. Another instance to illustrate an impromptu situation is when you are asked by a friend or a relative about your current or planned vacation trip or when you are campaigning for a position in school and you are asked by your fellow students to respond to their questions. </p>
    <h5> 1. Past, Present, Future </h5>
    <p> Example: In the past, I was not comfortable in making impromptu speeches because I could not think right away of what to say; maybe it was because of nervousness and lack of time to prepare. At present, however, I am enjoying it because I constantly practice and keep on exposing myself to any speaking situation. In the future, I look forward to teaching others how to survive impromptu speech situations. </p>
    <h5> 2. Point-Reason-Example/Explanation-Point </h5>
    <p> Example: <br>
    Point: I love Facebook. <br> <br>
    Reason: I have two reasons for this: one, it helps me easily reconnect with old friends; and, two, I am updated on the happenings around me. <br> <br>
    Example/Explanation: Through Facebook, I am able to contact my old friends from other countries and reminisce about wonderful memories. I am glad to be able to reconnect with friends even if it's only through online means. Also, through posts on Facebook, I learn about the current events in the country-a fact which has a bearing on my role as a citizen of this nation. <br> <br>
    Point: Facebook, indeed, is a useful social network site. That is why I love it. </p>
    <h5> 3. Opening, Rule of Three, Clincher </h5>
    <p> Example:
    Opening: Every time I see homeless families, it breaks my heart. That is why try to do at least three little things to help them. <br> <br>
    Rule of Three: 
    -   First, I feature them in my writings which I submit to editors for publication. I highlight their sad and bad experiences living in the Rule of Three streets and their dreams and aspirations in life. 
    -   Second, I actively participate in organizing and facilitating livelihood programs for these families. 
    -   Finally, I join different nonprofit organizations in campaigns and awareness activities against poverty. <br> <br>
    Clincher: These three are my baby steps toward achieving my vision of helping homeless people and freeing this nation from the bondage of poverty. <br> <br>
    In some cases, you may find yourself unaware of or uninterested in the topic. This is usually happens and it its inevitable. Distinguished Toastmaster Craig Harrison (2010) shares the following strategies that can help you address the problem. </p>

    <h5> Bridging </h5> <p> – This entails building a connection between what you do know and what you do not know. </p>
    <h5> Reframing </h5> <p> – this means rephrasing or redefining the topic into something that you want to talk about. This usually occurs if you think the topic is inappropriate or it is not meant for you. If you are given a topic that you do not like or is not right for you, don’t despair. Simply reframe it as a topic you’d like to respond to. Redefine the topic as you believe it should be, or at least way you’d like it to be. Keep the structure but alter the subject. Rephrase the question or even challenge it; you can even argue why the question given is not the right question at all. </p>
    <h5> Playing Devil’s Advocate </h5> <p> – This refers to you standing on the opposite side. </p>
 </div>
 <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Organizing and Delivering an (Extemporaneous Speech) </button>
    <div class="content">
    <h4>Definition of Extemporaneous Speech </h4> 
    <p> An extemporaneous speech is a planned and prepared speech. Unlike memorized or manuscript speeches which are delivered word-for-word, an extemporaneous speech is delivered with the help of short notes and a clear outline. Most people who speak in public often prefer the extemporaneous method of delivery. Although it might look more challenging than the manuscript or memorized speeches, it is more spontaneous and personal. </p>
    <h4>Three Steps in Studying your Extemporaneous Topic</h4>
    <p> 1. Identify the type of extemporaneous question that you have to answer. </p>
    <h5> Is it a question of fact? </h5>
    <p> This type of question is typically answerable by "Yes" or "No." It revolves around whether something is true or not, existent or not. <br>
    Example: <br>
    Q: Is Syria's crisis a problem of the whole world? </p>
    <h5> Is it a question of value? </h5>
    <p> It is centered on whether a topic is good or bad, moral or immoral, just or unjust. <br>
    Example: <br>
    Q: Is it better for the European nations to step in and aid Syria or ignore the country's civil crisis? </p>
    <h5> Is it a question of policy? </h5> 
    <p> It is focused on what policy or rule should be followed. 
    Example: <br> 
    Q: Should European countries enforce laws to accommodate Syrian refugees? <br> 
    2. Determine the purpose appropriate to your topic. <br> 
    3. Stick to your topic and look at all of the sides and angles of the problem. </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Steps in Preparing for a Successful Extemporaneous Speech </button>
    <div class="content">
    <h5> 1. Reinforce! </h5>  <p> -  You may explore other main points, but always refer back to your thesis. This will greatly help your audience remember your message. </p>
    <h5> 2. Capture! </h5> <p> - State the central idea of your extemporaneous speech in one declarative sentence. Keep your sentence specific. Ask yourself what you want your audience to know exactly. </p>
    <h5> 3. Develop! </h5> <p> - Now that you have a clear central idea, you are ready to map out the supporting points in an outline. </p>
    <h5> 4. Introduce! </h5> <p> - In the introduction, make sure you:<br>
    - grab the attention of the audience with a striking one-liner.<br>
    - give a short background by explaining why they have to listen.<br>
    - state your thesis </p>
    <h5> 5. Check! </h5> <p> - Develop at least three main points and check each of them with these questions:<br> 
    Does each point have one single idea?<br>
    Does each point reiterate the thesis statement?<br>
    Does each point prepare the discussion of the next main point? </p>
    <h5> 6. Supply! </h5> <p> - Make sure that each main point enough examples, testimonies, statistics, has or cases. In doing this, you give the audience new information or views to learn from. </p>
    <h5> 7. Conclude! </h5> <p> - Reinforce your introduction by coming up with a closing attention-getter that is related to your opening. Connect the needs and interest of your audience with the theme of your speech. Restate your thesis or review your main points. </p>

    <div class="content">
    <h5> Aims of an Entertainment Speech </h5> 
    <p> An entertainment speech aims to share goodwill, joy, and pleasure to the audience. The purpose of an entertainment speech is not to educate, inform, or inspire because the primary goal is to make the audience relax, enjoy, and even laugh. This means that you, speaker, are expected to be friendly and relaxed, but still courteous during the speech delivery. Moreover, you should know effectively. How to Make your audience well in order to entertain them may: <br><br>
    -   tell jokes;<br>
    -   share funny stories; <br>
    -   dramatize experiences; and<br>
    -   recall a scary story. </p>

    <div class="content">
    <h4> Entertaining Speech</h4>
    <h5> 1. Choose! </h5> <p> - Choose a light topic. Remember, you are there to give the audience a good time. </p> 
    <h5> 2. Enjoy! </h5> <p> - If you exude confidence and you obviously enjoy the moment, the audience will enjoy your presence, too. </p> 
    <h5> 3. Simplify! </h5> <p> - Simplify the flow of your speech. Your audience does not need a mentally exhausting message. </p> 
    <h5> 4. Visualize! </h5> <p> - Your words should be highly descriptive. Use vivid words and keep them flowing to make your audience feel as if they were in your story. </p> 
    <h5> 5. Surprise! </h5> <p> - Astonish your audience with unexpected twists in your presentation. The more you surprise them, the more entertaining your speech will become. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Organizing and Delivering an (Informative Speech) </button>
    <div class="content"> 
    <h4> Types of Informative Speeches </h4> 
    <p> Generally, there are four types of informative speeches which vary depending on the topic. These are speech about objects or people, speech about processes, speech about events, and speech about concepts. </p>
    <h5> Speech about objects or people </h5> <p> – This focuses on tangible items like gadgets, products, structures, or people. Visual Aids may be necessary. </p>
    <h5> Speech about processes </h5> <p> – This focuses on a process or sequence of events. Visual Aids are necessary. </p>
    <h5> Speech about events </h5> <p> – This focuses on an event that happened, is happening, or might happen in the future. </p>
    <h5> Speech about concepts </h5> <p> – This focuses on beliefs, knowledge, theories, principles, or ideas. </p>
    <br> <br>
    <h4>Organizational Patterns</h4>
    <p> An informative speech can follow different patterns of organization to arrange and frame the details effectively. </p> 
    <h5> Chronological Pattern </h5> <p> - This can be used if you want to present the history, evolution, or development of your topic in a sequential order, from past to present or beginning to end. </p> 
    <h5> Spatial Pattern </h5> <p> - this pattern is used when you want to talk about the physical structure of an object, or the way things fit together in a certain space (Glendale Community College; University of Washington Tacoma). Topics that deal with geography fit this pattern best. </p>

    <div class="content">
    <h4> Definition of Persuasive Speech </h4> 
    <p> Persuasive speaking is the form of communication that people of diverse backgrounds mostly engage in. This kind of speech can center on any arguably interesting topic under the sun. When you deliver your persuasive speech, your primary goal is to influence the thoughts, feelings, actions, and behaviors or attitudes of your listeners (Gamble & Gamble, 2012). Likewise, you also aim to change their perception and convince them that your argument is more important, practical, attainable, or feasible. In essence, you as a persuasive speaker advocate for whatever your message is. </p>
    
    <h4> Types of Claims in Persuasive Speech </h4>
    <h5> 1. Speech that Questions Fact </h5> 
    <p> - This type questions the existence of a particular event or happening. In this case, the persuasive speaker poses questions of fact, derives conclusions from different sources of information, and attempts to convince the audience to believe in his/her ideas. </p> 
    <h5> 2. Speech that Questions Value </h5> 
    <p> -  This type focuses on questions of value regarding topics on the self, family, friendship, religion, government, freedom, love, and money, among others. In this case, the persuasive speaker (1) makes a statement or claim which reflects his/her judgment, (2) attempts to convince his/her audience of his/her judgment, and (3) justifies it based on standards. </p> 
    <h5> 3. Speech that Questions Policy </h5> 
    <p> - This type questions the current state of things which can impact the future. In this case, the persuasive speaker asks relevant questions that can help in making a decision on whether or not something should be implemented, observed, or done. </p>

    <h4> Organizational Patterns </h4>
    <p> The following are some of the suggested patterns that you can use to organize your persuasive speech. </p>
    <h5> 1. A. F. O. R. E. S. T.  </h5> <p> (anecdotes, facts and figures, opinion, rhetorical questions, emotive language, superlatives, tripling)
    Below are the rules in applying this pattern: </p>
    <h5> A. Anecdotes </h5> <p> – Begin your speech with a personal story, observation, or experience. </p>
    <h5> B. Facts and Figures </h5> <p> – Provide striking statistics that can support your ideas. </p>
    <h5> C. Opinion </h5> <p> – Add in your opinion. You can begin your statement with, “I believe that....”. </p>
    <h5> D. Rhetorical Questions </h5> <p> – Think of and add engaging rhetorical questions (i.e., questions which do not intend to elicit answers, but to make a point.) </p>
    <h5> E. Emotive Language </h5> <p> – Appeal to your audience’s emotion. </p>
    <h5> F. Superlatives </h5> <p> – Use superlatives to exaggerate an idea. </p>
    <h5> G. Tripling </h5> <p> – The rule of three in the English writing principle simply entails using three words together to reinforce your point. This may add to the effectiveness of your persuasion. A classic example is Julius Caesar’s statement: “Veni, Vidi, Vici” (I came, I saw, I conquered). </p>
    <h5> 2. Problem- Solution </h5> <p> 
    Here’s how:
    A. Identify the problem.
    B. Provide a solution, which will show the practicality of your proposal. </p>
    <h5> 3. Problem – Cause – Solution </h5> <p> 
    Below are the rules in applying this pattern.
    A. Identify the problem.
    B. Analyze the root causes of the problem.
    C. Provide a solution to the problem. </p>
    <h5> 4. Comparative Advantages </h5> <p> 
    Below are the rules in applying this pattern.
    A. Identify the problem.
    B. Present at least two solutions to the problem.
    C. Compare the two in terms of practicality and feasibility. </p>
    <h5> 5. Monroe’s Motivated Sequence </h5> <p> 
    Alan Monroe, a professor from Purdue University, created an outline for making speeches based on the psychology of persuasion (Ehninger, Monroe, & Granbeck, 1978). This outline is known as Monroe's Motivated Sequence. <br> <br>
    Here’s how to apply this technique: <br>
    1. Grab the attention of the audience by identifying the challenge you plan to confront, or the problem you plan to address. <br> <br> 
    2. Establish the need or urgency to address the identified challenge or problem. <br> <br> 
    3. Present possible solutions to your audience to satisfy the need. <br> <br>
    4. Help your audience visualize. Use vivid words to convince your audience about the benefits they can gain from the solutions you presented. <br> <br> 
    5. Engage the audience to participate in promoting change through a call for action. </p>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Methods of Persuasion </button>
    <div class="content">
    <p> Consider what Lucas (2011) writes about how the audience can be persuaded by a speaker. The audience can be persuaded by the following reasons. <br> <br>
    -   They perceive that the speaker has credibility. <br> 
    -   They are convinced by the evidence presented by the speaker. <br> 
    -   They are convinced by the speaker's reasoning. <br> 
    -   Their emotions are touched by the speaker's ideas or use of language. <br> <br>
    The above ideas highlight some of the methods you can use in your persuasive speech. These methods are commonly used and proven to be effective by any prominent and excellent speaker across the globe. The following are some tips on how to enhance your credibility, how to use evidence, how to use reasoning, and how to observe ethics and emotional appeal in a persuasive speech. </p>

    <h5> 1. How to enhance your credibility </h5>
    <h5> A. Explain how you became an expert on the topic. </h5> 
    <p> You can do this by sharing how well you read, investigated, or researched the topic. For example: You could share that in the beginning you did not know much about your topic until you researched about it. By saying you researched on your topic, your audience will feel that you made an effort in building your credibility by collecting information. </p>
    <h5> B. Connect your experiences, beliefs, values or attitudes with your audience's. </h5> 
    <p> You can do this by telling your audience that you have the same experiences, beliefs, values or attitudes. For example: In the beginning of your speech, you can emphasize to your audience that regardless of background, status, age, gender, beliefs, and values, among others, you all have one thing in common and then add that which you have in common. By saying this, your audience will feel respected and comfortable because you can identify with their experiences, beliefs, or values. </p>
    <h5> C. Practice more often so you can deliver your speech with conviction. </h5> 
    <p> You can do this by exposing yourself more often to speaking situations such as reciting and reading announcements in class, introducing people in a program, hosting events, participating in debates, or acting as a spokesperson of a group. Also, simply practicing more often before your actual speech performance will increase your confidence and help you deliver your speech with conviction. </p>
    <h5> 2. How to use evidence </h5>
    <h5> A. Specify evidence. </h5> 
    <p> You can do this by citing statistics, research studies, and other valid and credible information. For example: When stating a fact, do Instead of not simply say a general detail. saying, "There is a law that protects women and their children against violence,' state the exact details, as in, "RA 9262 is an act that against violence." By specifying your evidence, protects women and their children you are saying. </p>
    <h5> B. Avoid outdated evidence. </h5> 
    <p> You can do this by reading and digging new evidence to keep yourself updated on the significant facts and figures. For example: If you are arguing about social networking site addiction and you are using data taken from 2000 or earlier, your speech might not hold enough credibility and it might not retain the interest of your audience as well. Since we are now in the Information Age, data quickly get old and replaced by more current ones, so they quickly become irrelevant. Therefore, always make sure to use current available data. This way, your speech will be more accurate, and your audiences will be more interested to listen. </p>
    <h5> C. Choose reputable or credible sources for your evidence. </h5> 
    <p> You can do this by carefully identifying and evaluating your sources. For example: You are persuading your audience that your solution in improving the interest of readers in Philippine literature is the most efficient method, but you cite sources such as fan sites, Wiki answers, Yahoo answers, or blogs. This creates a bad impression, as it might come off that your arguments and points are based on unreliable facts. As a guide, Google, Yahoo, or any search engine can provide you a wealth of reputable or credible sources for your evidence. </p>
    <h5> 3. How to use reasoning </h5>
    <p> Avoid logical fallacies or errors in reasoning. You can do this by studying the types of logical fallacies. The following are some of the most common errors in reasoning. </p>
    <h5> Ad Hominem: </h5> 
    <p> This happens when you attack the character of a person instead of his argument. Example: Professor X does not deserve to be the head of this organization because he is separated from his wife. How to avoid: When you give your rebuttal, focus on the arguments of the person, not on his/her character or values. </p>
    <h5> Circular Argument: </h5> 
    <p> This happens when the idea of a stated argument is repeated. Example: My mother is a good teacher because she teaches me well. How to avoid: Do not repeat the argument; instead, prove it. </p>
    <h5> False Analogy: </h5> 
    <p> This happens when two things, which might be alike in some respects, are compared and assumed to be similar in other ways. Example: President Aquino is the Socrates of the 21st century. How to avoid: Look at the characteristics, features, or components of two people or objects closely to see whether they can really be compared or not. </p>
    <h5> False Authority: </h5> 
    <p> This happens when a statement of someone who is not an expert in the field in question is being used in an argument. Example: I avoid drinking coffee at night because of the advice of my English teacher. How to avoid: Check properly the qualifications of the person being cited. </p>
    <h5> False Cause and Effect: </h5> 
    <p> This happens when the connection between two consecutive events are not clear. Example: Because I attended a party, I got a high grade in my persuasive speech. How to avoid: Clarify the connections between the events by explaining both backgrounds clearly. </p>
    <h5> Hasty Generalization: </h5> 
    <p> This happens when a conclusion is drawn from insufficient evidence. Example: The senator stuttered while giving his speech, therefore government officials are not good in public speaking. How to avoid: Provide enough pieces of evidence before making any conclusions. </p>
    <h5> Red Herring: </h5> 
    <p> This happens when the answer does not address the question. Example: Question: Should the President sign Cyberbullying bill into law? Answer: The President has other priorities. How to avoid: Do not avoid opposing arguments. Instead, address them properly. </p>
    <h5> 4. How to use emotional appeal </h5>
    <h5> A. Internalize what you are saying. </h5> 
    <p> The audience will be more convinced of your message if you also show conviction in what you are saying. For example: If you use emotionally charged words, but you deliver it in a monotonous voice, the audience will not see the sincerity of your message. Instead, make sure to observe your non-verbal cues and to ensure that you believe in what you are saying. </p>
    <h5> B. Use emotion appropriately. </h5> 
    <p> Although a well-executed emotional appeal can be used as a strong weapon in persuasive speech, take note to use it only when appropriate to the message. Use it as an accessory only; make sure not to replace evidence and reasoning with pure emotion. For example: If you are making a speech on a question of fact, there is little need to use emotion appeal to your audience since' you are dealing with facts and information. However, if you are making a persuasive speech to change a certain policy, you can add emotional appeal to your speech to capture not only the minds but also the hearts of your audience. </p>
