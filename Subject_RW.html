    Cohesion without coherence leads to illogical presentation of ideas. The writer appears to move on to another related idea without proper transition from the previous idea. <br> <br> 
    For example: <br>
    On top of that, we will also go swimming. My friends and I decided to gather. We are planning to play volleyball. <br> <br>

    “A teacher should motivate his students.” </p>

    <h5> Mechanics </h5> 
    <p> – is the set of convections on how to spell, abbreviate, punctuate, and capitalize. </p>

    <h6> Convections of Mechanics: </h6>
